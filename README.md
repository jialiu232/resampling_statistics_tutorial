# resampling_statistics_tutorial

This is a tutorial on resampling statistics I made for ABE516X class based on [Dr. Justin Bois's statistical classes](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/bois) on Datacamp. 

It covers three main resampling and statistical inference methods in python:

- Bootstrap confidence interval

- Permutation test

- Bootstrap hypothesis test
